## Vision

This application is a tool which can help people keep track of their tasks and allow them to structure their work. The users can create different lists of related things to do as well as create, remove and edit tasks in these lists. There are two parts of this application that are supposed to encourage the user to do their tasks:

1. The progression system which allows the user to seperate the task into smaller pieces and by doing so getting a sense of accomplishment each time they advance the progression. When the progression is at 100% the task is automatically marked as done.

2. The randomizing task system allows the user to get a random task to do which helps the user deciding what to actually do and by doing so making it easier to start.

## Description of code
The code consists of two classes which controls the inner functionality of the core purpose of the application, these are the ToDoItem and ToDoList. 

The ToDoItem handles the functionality of each task, getters and setters for attributes as well as methods handling the progression and marking the task as done. 

The ToDoList handles the lists of tasks and has an array of ToDoItems and handles not only naming the list but also creating, removing, finding and randomizing the ToDoItems of the specific list.

The ToDoView handles all printing and basically the view as well as input in the application while the MainController has the responsibility of connecting the view with the core functionality. The MainController also handles the set up and functionality of the module InterfaceCreator. 

The application has several parts which can be improved such as error handling in a better and more effective way. The functionality can be extended and the application can allow for more things that aligns with the vision of the app, simplifying tasks, deadlines etc. New functionality and more complex tools could be implemented that is related to the subject.
