## Description of application
This application is a tool which can help people keep track of their tasks and allow them to structure their work. The users can create different lists of related things to do as well as create, remove and edit tasks in these lists. There are two parts of this application that are supposed to encourage the user to do their tasks:

1. The progression system which allows the user to seperate the task into smaller pieces and by doing so getting a sense of accomplishment each time they advance the progression. When the progression is at 100% the task is automatically marked as done.

2. The randomizing task system allows the user to get a random task to do which helps the user deciding what to actually do and by doing so making it easier to start.
