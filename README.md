## Vision

This application is a tool which can help people keep track of their tasks and allow them to structure their work. The users can create different lists of related things to do as well as create, remove and edit tasks in these lists. There are two parts of this application that are supposed to encourage the user to do their tasks:

1. The progression system which allows the user to seperate the task into smaller pieces and by doing so getting a sense of accomplishment each time they advance the progression. When the progression is at 100% the task is automatically marked as done.

2. The randomizing task system allows the user to get a random task to do which helps the user deciding what to actually do and by doing so making it easier to start.

## Requirements

1. The user should be able to create a TODO list.
2. The list should contain what to do and the deadline.
3. The user should be able to create, remove and update the TODO items.
4. The user should be able to mark the TODO as finished.
5. The user should be able to advance the progression of the task.
6. If the task progression is 100% the task should be set to done.
7. The user should be able to get a random task suggestion.
8. The user should be able to keep randomizing tasks.
9. The user should be able to exit the program.
10. The user should be able to return to the main menu. 
11. When the user has marked a task as done, the progression should be removed.
